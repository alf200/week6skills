# week6skills

This is the repository for the week 6 skills lab for CMPINF 0010. This repo will contain a program that does something.
The program in this repo is an anagram detector. An anagram is a word or phrase that is formed by rearranging the letters from another word or phrase.
The program strips the two words inputted by the user of any capitalization and spaces, then checks to see if they are anagrams.
